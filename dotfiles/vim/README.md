===Whoa There, Partner===
This is a basic vim configuration script for systems where I need a functional vim install but I don't want to download or install anything extra. Think servers I need to dig through some logfiles on or similar.

If you want to use vim in a more day-to-day way to edit code and work on projects, I suggest using neovim. There is another configuration script available for that.

===Config Setup===

Run the following:
* chmod +x vim_configure.sh
* ./vim_configure.sh
