# What does this directory cover?

This directory has setup scripts to automate installation of a number of tools needed for developing, testing, and building applications. Depending on OS, this is more or less achievable. I include here a few folders with scripts for different OS/disto setups.

Please check the README.md for the specific system you are using for any steps which are still manual.

Generally I try to cover at least these tools:
- Ruby
- Virtualbox
- Vagrant
- Packer
- Docker

# No Warranty

Some of these may be out of date. I generally alternate between operating systems, and the ones I am using most often get updated the most often. Since some of these installations are pretty sensitive to specific version availability, they may break over time. YYMV.

# Pre-setup

Before using this there are a small number of things to be done:
- install git. Otherwise it's going to be hard to fetch this repo.

# Virtualbox

# Vagrant
